# Blinkit-Product-Price-Prediction-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit product data and building machine learning regression models to predict product prices. Multiple regression algorithms were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics + machine learning skills, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation.

##🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Blinkit product data
Encode categorical features for machine learning
Train multiple regression models
Compare models using R² Score and MSE
Identify the best-performing model for price prediction
